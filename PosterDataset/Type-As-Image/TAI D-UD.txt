TAI Poster 001 — Layered Visual Analysis (LVA)

Layer 1: Background Layer
A solid white background, with no texture, shadow, or gradient. The canvas is flat and uniform, serving as a neutral base for the bold typographic forms above. There is no visual noise — the background is purely functional and minimal.

Layer 2: Typography Layer (Primary Visual Structure)
Oversized black letterforms constructed from abstract geometric primitives — especially teardrop and wedge-like shapes — form the phrase “TEN YEARS OF DDP.”

The text fills the entire poster space, creating a full-bleed typographic grid.

Characters are heavily stylized, focusing on shape and mass rather than legibility.

Negative space is treated sculpturally, generating optical rhythm across the poster.

The type has no stroke or outline — it is filled with dense, pure black, contrasting sharply with the white background.

No recognizable font is used; the forms feel custom-drawn or modularly constructed.

Layer 3: Informational Text (Micro Detail Layer)
In the top left corner, a small block of legible sans-serif text is included, stating the date range:
“March, 2014 – March, 2024”

This block is unobtrusive and does not interfere with the overall typographic composition.

It serves as a minimal anchor for factual content, maintaining the poster' s ultra-clean aesthetic.

Decided Information
Title: SOUL POOL STRUT
Performer: DJ POOL
Presenter / Host: Echo System
Venue: Echo Beach
Date: June 10, 2023
Visual Direction:

Type‑as‑image composition

Psychedelic concentric‑ring motif

Vibrant duotone (hot‑pink & orange) over white base

Bold, chunky letterforms with retro curves

High‑contrast, riso‑print look

Undecided Information
Typography Treatment: Thick custom letterforms in black (slight magenta overlay), letters cut by concentric rings; readability secondary to graphic impact
Layout: Text stacked in three blocks (“SOUL POOL”, “STRUT”, “DJ POOL”) centered within target‑like rings, small header & footer text for presenter and details
Color & Texture: Overlapping neon pink and orange rings with subtle riso grain; thin white stroke between some rings creates depth
Background: Clean white border; rings and text bleed nearly to edges, creating poster‑within‑poster feel

TAI Poster 002 — Layered Visual Analysis (LVA)
Layer 1: Background Layer
Flat white sheet providing a crisp border; no texture or gradient.

Layer 2: Graphic Ring Layer
Series of large concentric circles (hot‑pink, vivid orange, alternating) printed in riso‑style duotone. Slight grain and edge fading emulate silkscreen noise. Rings are off‑center enough to produce dynamic negative shapes at the edges.

Layer 3: Typography Layer (Primary Visual)
Phrase “SOUL POOL STRUT BY DJ POOL” rendered in oversized, rounded modular letters. Letterforms are solid black but pick up magenta/orange tints where rings overlap, enhancing a psychedelic vibe. Text follows a centered vertical stack, filling most of the poster.

Layer 4: Micro‑Info Layer
Top center: small art‑deco “ECHO SYSTEM PRESENTS.”
Bottom center: venue and date in modest sans‑serif, maintaining alignment with ring center.

Decided Information
Title: 若くて愛らしい Su Punk
Date/Time: Friday 9 PM, Nov 2020
Venue / Host: Handle with Care, Seoul
Visual Direction:

Type‑as‑image using large kanji‑style glyphs

Duotone halftone texture (earthy brown + bright green)

White field with scattered accent stickers (yellow dots, green cubes)

Rough, distressed, print‑screen aesthetic

Playful, irregular layout with minimal readable micro‑text

Undecided Information
Typography Treatment: Hand‑drawn calligraphic glyphs rendered as halftone blocks; mis‑registered green over brown creates depth and grit
Layout: Vertical stack of two giant characters filling the sheet; small vertical info block in top‑left; accent shapes sprinkled organically
Color & Texture: Coarse halftone pattern, visible dots and edge fade; solid yellow circles with drop shadows and flat green squares behave like labels or confetti
Background: Clean white paper margin framing the central duotone print

TAI Poster 003 — Layered Visual Analysis (LVA)
Layer 1: Background Layer
Flat white sheet, no gradients; provides stark contrast for halftone duotone overlay.

Layer 2: Duotone Calligraphic Layer (Primary Visual)
Two oversized kanji‑inspired glyphs spanning the full canvas.

Printed in coarse halftone brown (base) with mis‑registered bright green overlay.

Edges rough; dot gain and overprint create mottled texture.

Forms are sculptural, strokes exaggerated into blade‑like terminals.

Layer 3: Accent Shape Layer
Randomly placed circular yellow stickers (with tiny drop shadows) and flat green square chips scattered across and around the glyphs, adding playful dimensional pops and guiding the eye.

Layer 4: Micro‑Information Layer
Slim vertical text column at top‑left: event title (Japanese), time, date, venue, host. Set in a light monospaced sans, aligning with white gutter space. Small “handle with care” logo mark lower‑left.
